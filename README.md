# hello

I set this Organization up and invited some people (more or less random picks from the ERPNext discussion forum to be honest)
to initiate some kind of gathered repository where community contributions (hopefully under the umbrella of the 
to be founded "ERPNext Software Foundation") can be hosted and maintained.

Excuse if this is a little abrupt, but I just wanted to leverage on the momentum I currently see in regards to the 
Foundation. Also I got the impression there is development being done in the Community but due to lack of such a location
neither the Community nor the ERPNext core Team @Frappe can leverage from these efforts.

I assume once the Foundation is actually in place it shall take over this github presence. This is not an attempt to hijack this.
